This sample guide describes several Asciidoctor attributes, values, and layout options available for producing a customized and polished document.

== Text size and justification

* *http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking[Fork] the repository* and clone it locally.
Connect your local to the original _upstream_ repository by adding it as a remote.

== Block titles

You can assign a title to any paragraph, list, delimited block, or block macro.
In most cases, the title is displayed immediately above the content.
If the content is a figure or image, the title is displayed below the content.

A block title is defined on a line above the element.
The line must begin with a dot (`.`) and be followed immediately by the title text with no spaces inbetween.

Here's an example of a list with a title:

.A titled list
====
.TODO list
- Learn the AsciiDoc syntax
- Install Asciidoctor
- Write my novel
====

== Metadata

In addition to a title, lists and blocks can be assigned metadata, including:

* Id (i.e., anchor)
* Style (first unnamed block attribute)
* Named block attributes
* Options

Here's an example of a quote block with metadata:

.Gettysburg Address <1>
[#gettysburg] <2>
[quote, Abraham Lincoln, Soldiers' National Cemetery Dedication] <3> <4> <5>
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure.
...

Fourscoreandsevenyearsagoourfathersbroughtforthonthiscontinentanewnation...
____
----
<1> Title: Gettysburg Address
<2> Id: gettysburg
<3> Style: quote
<4> attribution: Abraham Lincoln (Named block attribute)
<5> citetitle: Dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery (Named block attribute)

TIP: A block can have multiple block attribute lines.
The attributes will be aggregated.
If there is a name conflict, the last attribute defined wins.

Some metadata is used as supplementary content, such as the title, whereas other metadata controls how the block is rendered, such as the style.

== Delimited blocks

The AsciiDoc syntax provides a set of components for including non-paragraph text--such as block quotes, source code listings, sidebars and tables--in your document.
These components are referred to as _delimited blocks_ because they are surrounded by delimiter lines.

Within the boundaries of a delimited block, you can enter any content or blank lines.
The block doesn't end until the ending delimiter is found.
The delimiters around the block determine the type of block, how the content is processed and rendered, and what elements are used to wrap the content in the output.

=== Optional delimiters

If the content is contiguous (not interrupted by blank lines), you can forgo the use of the block delimiters and instead use the block style above a paragraph to repurpose it as one of the delimited block types.

NOTE: This format is often used for single-line listings or quotes.

.Single line listing block
[source]
----
[listing]
sudo yum install asciidoc
----

.Single line quote block
[source]
----
[quote]
Never do today what you can put off 'til tomorrow.
----

== Admonitions

There are certain statements that you may want to draw attention to by taking them out of the content's flow and labeling them with a priority.
These are called admonitions.
Asciidoctor provides five built-in admonition style labels:

Tip:: Used for giving the reader helpful advice.
Note:: Used to communicate related or follow-up information.
Important:: Used to remind the reader to do a critical step or task.
Warning:: Used to inform the reader of potential risks.
Caution:: Also used to inform the reader of potential risks, take your pick.

When you want to call attention to a single paragraph, start the first line of the paragraph with the label you want to use.
The label must be uppercase and followed by a colon (`:`).

WARNING: Wolpertingers are known to nest in server racks.
Enter at your own risk.

When you want to apply an admonition label to complex content, set the label as a style attribute on a delimited block.
Admonition labels are commonly set on example blocks.
This behavior is referred to as _masquerading_.
The label must be uppercase when set as an attribute on a block.

[IMPORTANT]
.Feeding the Werewolves
====
While werewolves are hardy community members, keep in mind the following dietary concerns:

. They are allergic to cinnamon.
. More than two glasses of orange juice in 24 hours makes them howl in harmony with alarms and sirens.
. Celery makes them sad.
====

== Quotes, Prose Excerpts, and Verses

Quotes, prose excerpts and verses share the same syntax structure, including:

* style attribute, either `quote` or `verse`
* name of who the content is attributed to
* bibliographical information of the book, speech, play, etc., where the content was drawn from
* excerpt text

.Anatomy of a basic quote
----
[quote, attribution, citation title and information]
Quote or excerpt text
----

For content that doesn't require the preservation of line breaks, set the +quote+ attribute in the first position of the attribute list.
Next, set the attribution and relevant citation information.
However, these positional attributes are optional.

If the quote is a single line or paragraph, you can place the attribute list directly on top of the text.

.after landing the cloaked Klingon bird of prey in Golden Gate park
[quote, James Kirk, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]
Everybody remember where we parked.

For those of you who want a little bit of culture in this document, here's an excerpt of a poem by Carl Sandburg.

[verse, Carl Sandburg, Fog]
____
The fog comes
on little cat feet.

It sits looking
over harbor and city
on silent haunches
and then moves on.
____

That's all folks!
